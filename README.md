# AoC 2020

This repository contains my solution for 2020s [Advent of Code challenges!](https://adventofcode.com/2020)
I will be participating in `Kotlin` ([source-files](https://github.com/KristofAchten/AoC2020/tree/master/kotlin/src)) and `Angular/typescript` ([source-files](https://github.com/KristofAchten/AoC2020/tree/master/angular/aoc/src/app)).

The output for the challenges (given my personalized input files) is automatically generated and shown below. Even though it is not important: these are the solutions as generated by my Kotlin implementations.
